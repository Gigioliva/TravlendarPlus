\section*{Abstract}

The main task of this document is to give a specification of the requirements that our system has to fulfil adopting the IEEE-STD-830-1993 standard for RASD documentation . It also introduces the functional and non-functional requirements via UML diagrams and a high level specification of the system. In the last part of this document it presents the formal model of the specification using Alloy analysis. \\

The information in this document are intended for the stakeholders and the developers of the project. For the stakeholders this document presents a description useful to understand the project development, meanwhile for the developers it’s an useful way to show the matching between the stakeholders’ requests and the developed solution.

\newpage

\chapter{Introduction}

In this section we will explain which are the main scopes of the Travlendar+ application and we will provide a general overview of all the features.

\section{Purpose}

The main purpose of the RASD document (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document) is to highlight the domain in which the system will work and the primary use cases.\\

The document below specifies who will use the system, the reason for which the system is developed, what services will be provided and the environment in which the system finds its use.
We will need to define the functional and not functional requirements of the system. \\

The main goals to be achieved are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The user wants to schedule his meetings
	\item The user wants to reach the place of his meeting with the most optimized path
	\item The user wants to know the weather forecast to be better organized for the journey
	\item The user wants to use the means of transport he prefers
	\item The user wants to purchase the tickets for the used means of transport 
	\item The user wants to localize means of shared transport whenever they are around him
	\item The user wants to be sure there are no overlapping in his schedule
	\item The user wants to keep a range of time for his breaks
	\item The user wants to use only a specific kind of means of transport
	\item The user wants to modify his meetings ad rearrange his schedule 
	\item The user wants to share the time of his meetings
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}

The scope of this application (Travlendar \Plus) is provide a tool for the target users to schedule in an effective way their time optimizing the travels.\\

Travlendar+ allows to create a calendar which fits the meetings and other kind of commitments.
The key feature of this application is to determine if the meeting location is reachable in the scheduled time and then provide a fast way to get to the destionation, otherwise it notify the user that it is not possibile by any mean to fullfill the request. Furthermore the application also arranges the schedule in a flexible way for some kind of events (like the lunch) and offers the possibility to slightly change its time.\\

In the creation of the user's calendar it also takes into account the current weather condition to make smarter decisions. As example, if the user show interest in using bike or a bike sharing service, during a sunny day, the system will favor a suitable path.\\

The user is invited to provide his order of preferences in terms of means of transport. In this way, he is free to choose if use bus, train or subway in a particular day. It is possible to select as well if you want to use a car or bike (your or a sharing service's one). The system also retrieves information about the current path situation like traffic jam or strikes and immediatly find alternative solutions.\\

With Travlendar+ is possible as well to buy public transport's tickets on the fly for the journey. If the user requires often the same path, he is suggested by the application to buy the best offered subscription.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}

We are going to release a cross-platform web application which will be able to run on every device. This application won't provide an interface for the service administrator, because it is possible from the server side.\\

As we are developing a WebApp, we are willing to release custom API for any future application in order to facilitate further implementations.\\

\subsection*{World and Machine model interpretation}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{phenomena}
	\caption{Relation between world and machine phenomena}
\end{figure}

From now on we will refer to \textbf{world} as everything that not concern our system and \textbf{machine} as everything about our system. Therefore \textbf{world's phenomena} are all the external events happening in the world and \textbf{machine's phenomena} are the events related to the system. There are as well some \textbf{shared phenomena} which are observable by both the parts.\\

In our case the world's phenomena are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bus out of service or other mechanical failure in public transports
	\item Closed roads due to a public demonstration
\end{itemize}
In our case the machine's phenomena are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Estimation and managing of users' free time 
	\item Database query
	\item User's registration
\end{itemize}
In our case the shared phenomena are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tracking of public transport's means
	\item Strikes and public services manifestation
\end{itemize}


\section{Product Functions}

The product provide to users a simple and user-friendly interface to schedule their events and help them to organize their journey.\\

In particular the system is expected to be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let the guest register and log in as users
	\item Schedule several events for every user
	\item Computate the best possible path for the daily journey
	\item Notify the user if the current journey is not realizable and why
	\item Interact with third part and sharing services 
	\item Let the user buy tickets for the ride
	\item Support the user during the whole travel
	\item Allow the user to insert his preferred choice for the used transports
	\item Gives a real time evaluation of the environmental conditions (like strikes and weather situation) and uses it to find the best choice for the journey.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Characteristics}


We don't require the user to be particulary skilled in new technologies as we expect the users to be aware and capable of using basic functions of mobile devices.\\

The actors we identified are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Guests}: people that haven't yet gained credentials to access the full service are only able to check the best journey options with some restrictions: they cannot save their schedule nor buy tickets or use third part sharing services.
	\item \textbf{Users}: guests that are currently registered to Travlendar+ and already verified their credentials (as e-mail address). Such users are able to log in and access full service with no restrictions.
\end{itemize}
\section{Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints\\}

\subsection*{Costraints}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Hardware limitations}: Our application runs on every mobile device like smartphones and tablets, independently of the OS (will run on Android, iOS and Windows Phone). Therefore, as the App consumes a low amount of RAM, the only hardware constraint for the users is to have a mid-range device. (for instance Nexus 4 or better for Android, iPhone 5 or better for iOS and Nokia Lumia 520 for Windows Mobile).
	\item \textbf{Interface to other applications}: The system needs to interfaces itself with other third part applications in order to provide the capability of buying tickets and booking sharing services.
	\item \textbf{Parallel operations}: The application must be able to handle multiple parallel requests from several users granting a high reactivity.
	\item \textbf{Availability limitations}: The system's uptime and availability are around the 98\% corresponding to a maximum downtime of $3.36h$ per week.
	\item \textbf{Privacy Constraints}: The personal informations of the users, as for instance the current geo-position, must be safely stored and not reachable to other people.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Assumptions and Dependecies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Internet Connection}: the device used by the users dispose of an internet connection and a sufficient bandwidth to use the application.
	\item \textbf{Device GPS}: the device used by the users dispose of a built in GPS Localizer.
	\item \textbf{Public transports tracking}: all the public transports are real time localized
	\item \textbf{No privileged users}: there are no priviled users or administrators with particular functions
	\item \textbf{No user connections}: every user is independent from the others, and their schedule does not affect by any mean the others schedules
	\item \textbf{Weather information not available}: when the weather informations are not available, the system computates the schedules without considering them
	\item \textbf{Booking range}: we assume that the users are not interested in planning events that will occur later than a week
	\item \textbf{City Location}: the users live and uses the application in the surroundings of Milan
	\item \textbf{Weather information provided}: we assume that the weather informations are correct and provided by a third part
	\item \textbf{Shared services provided}: we assume that the sharing services are working and provided by a third part
	\item \textbf{Host availability}: the server which hosts the application has an uptime greater or equal to the uptime of the application
	\item \textbf{Battery duration}: user's device's battery duration is enough to permit the fullfillment of the journey.
	\item \textbf{API availability}: the API provided by third part's services are always available
	\item \textbf{Break/Lunch time}: we assume that the user will eat near the same place of the event before the break.
	\item \textbf{OS Permission Granted}: the user will always grant to his OS's device the permission to access to all the needed services
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interfaces Requirements}
\subsection*{User Interface}

The user interface must be user-friendly volted to guarantee to the final user an easy way to interact with the application. The development of the front end is realized due to HTML and CSS to provide a responsive interface for all devices.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{mockups/TicketsBuy}
	\caption{Mockup: This interface allow the user to perform the buy operation and complete his transaction}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Hardware Interface}

The system must be able to acquire the correct position of the means of transport and sharing services' vehicles. In order to acquire such data, every mean of transport must have a GPS localizer and internet connection to communicate its position to their server.

\subsection*{Software Interface}

The system in order to be developed, both on the front-end side and back-end side, needs the use of the following programming, markup and representation languages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item JavaScript
	\item HTML
	\item CSS
	\item Python
	\item SQL
	\item JSON
\end{itemize}
There are no particular limitation about the OS of the user's devices, as the application is cross-platform and can be also used with modern browsers.

\subsection*{Communication Interface}

The communication between client and server happens using HTTPS by TCP protocol using port 443. A crypted channel is also used in order to perform secure transactions with third part sellers.

On the other hand the connection which allow to download public informations from third part API provided by major services like Google uses HTTP with port 80.

\subsection*{Scenario 5}

John is a common Travlendar+ user and very often needs the application in order to schedule his appointments during the day. Sometimes he is so busy that he actually forgets to renew his weekly bus subscription. John isn't worried about that, because he knows that he can do it manually using Travlendar+ which will automatically allow him to choose his preferred payment method and perform the transaction when he creates the event. After the transaction, John wants to be sure that the ticket is actually there, so he checks his Tickets section, where all his tickets are stored.

\subsection*{Scenario 6}

John is a really busy man, and sometimes he has even like 5 events during the day. Whenever a colleague of his, which is a Travlendar+ user as well, asks him "What are you doing tomorrow?" he doesn't really remember. But John knows that with Travlendar+ it is actually easy to share his daily schedule with other users, so he decide just to send them all his events of a given day.

\section{Performance Requirements}

As the application will operate in large cities and therefore interacting with many users at the same time, the system must guarantee a certain reliabilty and fault tolerance. In particular, requests to server must be fullfilled within 5 seconds serving up to XXX users (or YYY parallel requests)

\section{Design Constraints}

The system has to memorize and store users' tickets and subscriptions in accordance with the formats provided by the local public transport services. It also has to memorize the users' driving licence with the correct format.

\section{Software System Attributes}

\subsection*{Availability}

The system is requested to have an availability around 98\% corresponding to a maximum downtime of 3.36h per week. In order to achieve this, the server used must be part of a server farm. In this way, even if a single machine ends up being unreachable, the others still work and keep the OS up.

\subsection*{Security}

The system has to guarantee that only users can actually browse and access to all the application's feature, like the creation of a schedule, the purchase of tickets and so on. On the other hand, guests must be able only to check the best route to a certain destination. Moreover, all the users' informations cannot be viewed nor modified by other people. For this purpose the system, before the creation of a new event, requires a login (composed by user and password).\\

It is also fundamental the persistance of such datas, achieved with periodic backups which will be the base of a system recovery. Every exchange of information between server and client must be encrypted in order to avoid leaks of sensitive data.

\subsection*{Portability}

The system must be developed to ease the use of the application on any mobile device. Furthermore, it has to be developed in order to run smoothly on different kinds of tablets or smartphones with several OS like Android, iOS and Windows Phone. The access to the application will be also available from any modern browser on PC.

\subsection*{Maintainability}

The system must be implemented with an architecture that will ease the evolution of the software and its maintainability. For such purpose, the developing will require the use of an Object Oriented Language to partition the code in several classes and make it more readable. It is also required a documentation about the used method's behaviour and guarantee an easy approach to the code in future uses.
